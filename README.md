# 🧰 Python CLI Tools

A growing collection of small, focused Python command-line projects built to practice and refine core programming fundamentals.

Each tool is intentionally kept simple, self-contained, and readable — prioritising clean logic and structure over unnecessary complexity.

## ✨ About This Repository

This repository acts as a **sandbox for learning** and experimentation.  
Instead of one large project, it contains multiple mini tools, each targeting a specific concept such as:

- user input & validation
- control flow and state management
- authentication logic
- file-based persistence (JSON)
- terminal UI and menus

Projects are added over time as new ideas or concepts are explored.

---

## 📂 Structure

- Each folder represents a **standalone tool**
- Each tool can be run independently
- Completed tools are usually left stable rather than endlessly modified

---

## 🛠 Tools Included

Examples of tools you may find in this repository:
- ATM system simulations
- Login & authentication systems

More projects will be added as learning progresses.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into a project directory
3. Run the tool

Example:
```bash
